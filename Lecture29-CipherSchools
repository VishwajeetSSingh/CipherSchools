Introduction to Machine Learning
What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. It encompasses the ability of computers to think, learn, and make decisions.

Key AI Terms:

Learning: The process by which AI systems improve their performance over time.
Reasoning: The capability to draw conclusions and make decisions based on data.
Self-Correction: The ability of AI systems to correct mistakes and improve their accuracy.
Types of AI:

Weak AI (Narrow AI): Designed to perform specific tasks or solve particular problems. It does not possess general intelligence or consciousness.
Strong AI (General AI): Hypothetical AI that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence in a manner similar to human beings.
What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses statistical methods to enable machines to improve their performance with experience.

Human Learning: Observations ➡ Learning ➡ Skills
Machine Learning: Data ➡ Model/Predictor ➡ Predict
Types of ML:

Supervised Learning:

Description: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data and corresponding labels are provided. The model learns to make predictions based on this data.
Process: Labeled Data & Labels ➡ Machine ➡ ML Model ➡ Predictions ➡ Test Data
Examples: Email spam classification, cat-dog classification.
Unsupervised Learning:

Description: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset. It tries to identify patterns and relationships within the data without predefined labels.
Process: Data ➡ Model ➡ Clusters/Patterns
Examples: Clustering, recommendation systems.
Clustering:

Description: A type of unsupervised learning that involves grouping similar data points into clusters based on their features.
Examples: Customer segmentation, grouping similar documents.
Applications:

Email Spam Classification: Supervised Learning
Recommendation System: Both Supervised and Unsupervised
Cat-Dog Classification: Supervised Learning
Cat-Dog Clustering: Unsupervised Learning
Playing AlphaGo: Both Supervised and Unsupervised
Evolution of AI
Artificial Intelligence (1950s-1980s): Techniques to mimic human behavior and intelligence.
Machine Learning (1980s-2010s): Techniques that allow computers to learn from data and improve without being explicitly programmed.
Deep Learning (2010s-Present): A subset of ML focusing on neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in data.
What is Data Science?
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses statistical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. It involves analyzing and interpreting data to make informed decisions.

Sources of Data: Databases, business transactions, sensors, and more.
Techniques Used: Statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization.
Objective: Build predictive models and derive actionable insights to inform decision-making.
Data Science combines elements from statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to solve complex problems and uncover hidden patterns in data.
