Principles of Data Visualization
What is Data Visualization?
Data visualization involves presenting data in visual formats like charts, graphs, and maps. This approach helps in understanding and interpreting complex datasets by making patterns, trends, and outliers more visible. It's especially effective for communicating findings, as visuals can be more intuitive and accessible than raw data or statistical models.
