Data Science Project Lifecycle:
Understanding the Problem

Clearly define the project's goals.
Establish success criteria.
Identify the type of problem, such as classification or regression.
Collecting Relevant Data

Gather data from various sources.
Ensure the data is pertinent to the problem.
Consider the data's volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.
Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
Conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the data.
Normalize or scale the data if necessary.
Feature Engineering and Feature Extraction

Create new features that can enhance model performance.
Reduce the feature space if it is too large.
Select the most important features for the model.
Model Building and Deployment

Select suitable algorithms and train the models.
Validate the model's performance using cross-validation.
Deploy the model for either real-time usage or batch processing.
