Hypothesis Testing & Inferential Statistics
Hypothesis Testing

Definition:
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to infer that a specific condition holds for the entire population.

Steps in Hypothesis Testing:

State the Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): A statement of no effect or no difference. It represents the default or baseline assumption.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha): A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis, indicating the presence of an effect or difference.
Choose a Significance Level (α):

Commonly used values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10. This threshold determines the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).
Collect Data and Compute a Test Statistic:

Test statistics are computed based on the data and the type of test being used (e.g., Z-test, T-test, ANOVA, Chi-square).
Determine the P-value:

The P-value represents the probability of observing the data, or something more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
Make a Decision:

Compare the P-value to the significance level α:
If 
𝑃
≤
𝛼
P≤α, reject the null hypothesis.
If 
𝑃
>
𝛼
P>α, fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Types of Tests:

Z-test: Used when the sample size is large (n > 30) and the population variance is known.
T-test: Used when the sample size is small (n ≤ 30) or the population variance is unknown.
ANOVA: Used to compare means across multiple groups.
Chi-square Test: Used for categorical data to assess the association between variables.
Scenario Example:
A basketball coach claims his team scores more than 50 points on average. To test this:

State the Hypotheses:

H₀: μ = 50 (average score is 50)
H₁: μ > 50 (average score is greater than 50)
Collect Data:

Suppose the sample mean score from 5 games is 51.2.
Compare Sample Mean:

If the sample mean is greater than 50, it suggests supporting the coach's claim.
Decision:

Based on this simple comparison (without formal statistical testing), the evidence seems to support the coach’s claim.
Applications:

A/B Testing: Testing two versions of a webpage to see which one performs better in terms of conversion rates.
Medicine: Testing the efficacy of a new drug against a placebo.
Inferential Statistics

Key Concepts:

Population and Sample:

Population: The entire group of interest.
Sample: A subset of the population used to draw conclusions about the population.
Estimation:

Point Estimation: Provides a single value estimate of a population parameter (e.g., sample mean as an estimate of the population mean).
Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals): Provides a range of values within which the parameter is expected to lie, with a certain degree of confidence.
Common Point Estimators:

Sample Mean (
𝑥
ˉ
x
ˉ
 ): Estimate of the population mean (
𝜇
μ).
Sample Proportion (
𝑝
^
p
^
​
 ): Estimate of the population proportion (
𝑝
p).
Sample Variance (
𝑠
2
s 
2
 ): Estimate of the population variance (
𝜎
2
σ 
2
 ).
Example:
If you calculate the average score of a sample of students, this average is a point estimate of the overall average score for all students.

Components of Confidence Intervals:

Confidence Level: Indicates the probability that the interval contains the true population parameter (e.g., 95% confidence).
Margin of Error: The range within which the true parameter is expected to fall.
Formula for Confidence Interval:
For a population mean:

Where:

𝑥

x
ˉ
  is the sample mean.
𝑧
z is the z-score for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence).
𝑠
s is the sample standard deviation.
𝑛
n is the sample size.
Example Calculation:
If a sample mean score is 75, the sample standard deviation is 10, and the sample size is 30, for a 95% confidence interval:

𝑧
z for 95% confidence is 1.96.

The interval is approximately [71.43, 78.57].
These concepts are fundamental in understanding and applying statistical methods to draw conclusions from data and make informed decisions.
